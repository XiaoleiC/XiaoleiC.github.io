## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>, -->
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at UC Berkeley,
<!-- 's <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> Grossman School of Medicine</a> -->
<!-- , specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>. Under the mentorship of Prof.  -->
working with Prof.<a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/ziqiwang" target="_blank"> Ziqi Wang</a>. My research interests include understanding community resilience (by leveraging the knowledge of statistical physics, e.g., renormalization group and mean field theory), scientific machine learning, and uncertainty quantification (surrogate model and advanced Monte Carlo techniques). I am also interested in LLM. My previous research topics are Bayesian system identification and hurricane simulation.

Before joining Berkeley, I completed my master's degree at Tongji University, advised by Prof. <a href= "https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/60/0e/c14928a155662/page.htm" target = "_blank"> Yaojun Ge</a> and Prof. <a href= "https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/a0/4c/c14930a303180/page.htm" target = "_blank"> Wei Cui</a>. I got my bachelor's degree at Southwest Jiaotong University.
<!-- and my bachelor's degree in International Finance from <a href="https://www.cueb.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> Capital University of Economics and Business</a>.  -->

<!-- 
I am an alumnus of the <a href="https://opencasestudies.github.io/" target="_blank"> Open Case Study Project</a> at <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank"> the Bloomberg School of Public Health </a> of <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> the Johns Hopkins University</a>. -->

Outside academia, I like road trips, swimming, hiking, skiing, running, and exploring different restaurants.

## Current topics
In the spring of 2025, I am working on machine learning methods for the lattice Boltzmann equations, a mesoscale CFD method. We use the neural network/operator to approximate the equilibrium operator, which is usually hard to formulate. We will test the algorithm on various classical problems. Specifically, we will use it for the traffic flow simulation.


## Previous topics
In the summer and fall of 2024, I worked on understanding the community's psychological polarization during hazards. We employed a bottom-up method and constructed the system Hamiltonian. Traditional techniques from statistical physics, e.g., mean-field theory and renormalization group, were widely used to infer the macroscopic collective phenomena directly from the microscopic interactions. The paper is coming out soon.

## Research Interests
- **Scientific Machine Learning:** spatial-temporal stuff, like PDE
- **Statistical Physics:** mean field theory, renormalization group, equilibrium, non-equilibrium
- **Community Resilience:** human-centric analysis, adaption considering the climate change
- **Large Language Model:** sentiment analysis (BERT, etc.)
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Monte Carlo simulation, surrogate model
- **Bayesian system identification:** emphasis is on structural health monitoring
- **Hurricane simulation:** Vickery's empirical full-track model
