## About Me
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at UC Berkeley, working with Prof.<a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/ziqiwang" target="_blank"> Ziqi Wang</a>. My research interests include understanding community resilience (by leveraging the knowledge of statistical physics, e.g., renormalization group and mean field theory), AI and scientific machine learning, and uncertainty quantification (surrogate model and advanced Monte Carlo techniques). 
<!-- I am fortunate to collaborate with Prof.<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/" target="_blank"> Michael Mahoney</a>'s group. -->
My previous research topics are Bayesian system identification and hurricane simulation.

Before joining Berkeley, I completed my master's degree at Tongji University, advised by Prof. <a href= "https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/60/0e/c14928a155662/page.htm" target = "_blank"> Yaojun Ge</a> and Prof. <a href= "https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/a0/4c/c14930a303180/page.htm" target = "_blank"> Wei Cui</a>. I got my bachelor's degree at Southwest Jiaotong University.
<!-- and my bachelor's degree in International Finance from <a href="https://www.cueb.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> Capital University of Economics and Business</a>.  -->


Outside academia, I like road trips, swimming, hiking, skiing, running, and exploring different restaurants.

## Current topics
In the spring of 2025, I am working on scientific machine learning methods for spatial-temporal problems. I will join the Scientific Data Division of the Berkeley Lab as a Ph.D. intern and work with Prof.<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/" target="_blank"> Michael Mahoney</a> in the 2025 summer.


## Previous topics
In the summer and fall of 2024, I worked on understanding the community's psychological polarization during hazards. We employed a bottom-up method and constructed the system Hamiltonian. Traditional techniques from statistical physics, e.g., mean-field theory and renormalization group, were widely used to infer the macroscopic collective phenomena directly from the microscopic interactions. The paper is coming out soon.

## Research Interests
- **Scientific Machine Learning:** spatial-temporal stuff, like PDE
- **Statistical Physics:** mean field theory, renormalization group, equilibrium, non-equilibrium
- **Community Resilience:** human-centric analysis, adaption considering the climate change
- **Large Language Model:** sentiment analysis (BERT, etc.)
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Monte Carlo simulation, surrogate model
- **Bayesian system identification:** emphasis is on structural health monitoring
- **Hurricane simulation:** Vickery's empirical full-track model
