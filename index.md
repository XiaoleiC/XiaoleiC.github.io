## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>, -->
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at UC Berkeley,
<!-- 's <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> Grossman School of Medicine</a> -->
<!-- , specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>. Under the mentorship of Prof.  -->
working with Prof.<a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/ziqiwang" target="_blank"> Ziqi Wang</a>. My research interests include understanding community resilience by leveraging the knowledge of statistical physics, e.g., renormalization group and mean field theory. My previous research topics are Bayesian system identification, uncertainty quantification, and hurricane simulation.

Before joining Berkeley, I completed my master's degree at Tongji University, advised by Prof. <a href= "https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/60/0e/c14928a155662/page.htm" target = "_blank"> Yaojun Ge</a> and Prof. <a href= "https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/a0/4c/c14930a303180/page.htm" target = "_blank"> Wei Cui</a>. I got my bachelor's degree at Southwest Jiaotong University.
<!-- and my bachelor's degree in International Finance from <a href="https://www.cueb.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> Capital University of Economics and Business</a>.  -->

<!-- 
I am an alumnus of the <a href="https://opencasestudies.github.io/" target="_blank"> Open Case Study Project</a> at <a href="https://www.jhsph.edu/" target="_blank"> the Bloomberg School of Public Health </a> of <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank"> the Johns Hopkins University</a>. -->

Outside academia, I like road trips, swimming, hiking, skiing, running, and exploring different restaurants. Recently, I am learning to be a photographer :)

## Current topics
In the 2024 summer, I am working on understanding the community's psychological polarization during hazards. We employ a bottom-up method and construct the system Hamiltonian. Traditional techniques from statistical physics are widely used, e.g., mean field theory and renormalization group, to infer the macroscopic collective phenomena directly from the microscopic interactions.

## Research Interests
- **Statistical Physics:** mean field theory, renormalization group, equilibrium, non-equilibrium
- **Community Resilience:** human-centric analysis, adaption considering the climate change
- **Large Language Model:** sentiment analysis (BERT, etc.)
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Monte Carlo simulation, surrogate model
- **Bayesian system identification:** emphasis is on structural health monitoring
- **Hurricane simulation:** Vickery's empirical full-track model
