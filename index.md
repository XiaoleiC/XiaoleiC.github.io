## About Me
<span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold;">
Actively exploring internship, part-time, and full-time (expected graduation time is December 2026/May 2027, which is flexible) opportunities as a Research Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer in tech. Let’s connect!
</span>

I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, working with Prof.<a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/ziqiwang" target="_blank"> Ziqi Wang</a>. My research interests include LLM post-training, generative models (diffusion and flow matching), and graph learning. I also do research in statistical physics (mean-field theory, renormalization group) and uncertainty quantification. I am always open to research collaborations, especially on LLM and generative models. Please feel free to connect! Before joining Berkeley, I got my master's degree (with honors) at Tongji University and bachelor's degree (with honors) at Southwest Jiaotong University.

Outside academia, I like road trips, swimming, hiking, skiing, running, and exploring different restaurants.

## Current topics
Multimodal sentiment analysis by fine-tuning LLM (<a href="https://github.com/Nutlettt/EPC" target="_blank"> repo here</a>); text-to-image generation by diffusion (<a href="https://xiaoleic.github.io/CS280A/project5/index.html" target="_blank"> portfolio here</a>).

## Previous topics
In the spring and summer of 2025, I worked on scientific machine learning methods for spatial-temporal problems. I joined the Scientific Data Division of the Berkeley Lab as a Ph.D. research intern and worked with Prof.<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/" target="_blank"> Michael Mahoney</a>. We proposed a kinetic theory-based graph learning framework for flow forecasting, e.g., traffic. The paper is under preparation.

In the summer and fall of 2024, I worked on understanding emotion dynamics during hazards. We employed a bottom-up method and constructed the system Hamiltonian. Traditional techniques from statistical physics, such as mean-field theory and the renormalization group, have been widely used to infer macroscopic collective phenomena directly from microscopic interactions. The paper is coming out soon.

## Research Interests
- **Large Language Model:** multimodal sentiment analysis (BERT, BLIP, etc.)
- **Generative Model:** diffusion model, flow matching, VAE
- **Scientific Machine Learning:** spatial-temporal forecasting, like PDE
- **Statistical Physics:** mean field theory, renormalization group, equilibrium, non-equilibrium
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** importance sampling, sequential Monte Carlo, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, surrogate model
- **Bayesian System Identification:** emphasis is on structural health monitoring
- **Hurricane Simulation:** Vickery's empirical full-track model
