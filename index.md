## About Me
<span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold;">
Actively exploring internship, part-time, and full-time (expected graduation time is December 2026/May 2027, which is flexible) opportunities as a Research Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer in tech. Letâ€™s connect!
</span>

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering at UC Berkeley, working with Prof.<a href="https://ce.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/ziqiwang" target="_blank"> Ziqi Wang</a>. My research interests include AI, scientific machine learning, and uncertainty quantification (surrogate model and advanced sampling techniques). I also developed a systematic approach to understanding community resilience from a statistical physics perspective (e.g., renormalization group and mean-field theory). 
<!-- I am fortunate to collaborate with Prof.<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/" target="_blank"> Michael Mahoney</a>'s group. -->
My research topics also include Bayesian system identification and hurricane simulation.

Before joining Berkeley, I completed my master's degree at Tongji University, advised by Prof. <a href= "https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/60/0e/c14928a155662/page.htm" target = "_blank"> Yaojun Ge</a> and Prof. <a href= "https://bridge.tongji.edu.cn/a0/4c/c14930a303180/page.htm" target = "_blank"> Wei Cui</a>. I got my bachelor's degree from Southwest Jiaotong University.
<!-- and my bachelor's degree in International Finance from <a href="https://www.cueb.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> Capital University of Economics and Business</a>.  -->


Outside academia, I like road trips, swimming, hiking, skiing, running, and exploring different restaurants.

## Current topics
In the fall of 2025, I am working on generative AI and LLM.


## Previous topics
In the spring and summer of 2025, I worked on scientific machine learning methods for spatial-temporal problems. I joined the Scientific Data Division of the Berkeley Lab as a Ph.D. research intern and worked with Prof.<a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/" target="_blank"> Michael Mahoney</a>. We proposed a kinetic theory-based graph learning framework for flow forecasting, e.g., traffic. The paper is under preparation.

In the summer and fall of 2024, I worked on understanding the community's psychological polarization during hazards. We employed a bottom-up method and constructed the system Hamiltonian. Traditional techniques from statistical physics, such as mean-field theory and the renormalization group, have been widely used to infer macroscopic collective phenomena directly from microscopic interactions. The paper is coming out soon.

## Research Interests
- **Scientific Machine Learning:** spatial-temporal problems, like PDE
- **Large Language Model:** sentiment analysis (BERT, etc.)
- **Statistical Physics:** mean field theory, renormalization group, equilibrium, non-equilibrium
- **Community Resilience:** human-centric analysis, adaptation considering climate change
- **Uncertainty Quantification:** Monte Carlo simulation, surrogate model
- **Bayesian system identification:** emphasis is on structural health monitoring
- **Hurricane simulation:** Vickery's empirical full-track model
